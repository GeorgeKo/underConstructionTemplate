# underConstructionTemplate
Simple HTML/CSS responsive template to use as an under-construction page.

A second HTML file has been created, under the name "index-internalCSS.css" for the use of it as single block of code when needed (*i.e. custom under construction page in Wordpress Plugins like SeedProd's Under Construction Plugin.*)
